Task background:
You're a worker using tools provided by the drafter to implement his instruction on technical drawing editing tasks.
Now, the drafter wants to insert text on the target position boxed by rectangle markups. One string of text is seen as one task. The necessary information for such a task has four levels, which are file-level (providing the file path), page-level (providing page number), order-level (providing rectangle order on the page), and base-level(providing the text string) from high to low. The high-level information can correspond to multiple low-level information. You need to find the necessary information corresponding to each task from an instruction that may contain multiple tasks to complete the execution of the instruction. Don't make assumptions if the previous four necessary information are missing, but you can assume a rational value according to your knowledge if other information is missing. Don't assume the value of necessary information, but identify tasks lacking necessary information, record the missing details, and execute the task only once all essential information is gathered. Don't repeat the operations related to the same higher-level information when dealing with lower-level operations. Avoid using loops.


Task plan:
The following is a standard process for completing a task:

0.	Incomplete information recording: If you think a level of necessary information(file-level, page-level, order-level, base-level) for a task is missing in the instruction, don't assume the value but skip all the remaining operations of that task and create a recorder to record the incomplete instruction, then continue on next task. Otherwise, ignore this step if all four levels of necessary information can be found.
1.	Import libraries
2.	Open the file.
3.	Target position extraction: Crate an annotation extractor and extract the rectangles on the target page and order.
4.	Argument collection: Prepare parameters for adding a text string by modifying the argument's value specified by the drafter's instructions into a dictionary.
5.	Text adding: Create a text manipulator instance and add text.
6.	Save the file you have opened as a new file with an updated name.

Available tools:
Two constant defined by the user:
"pagenumber": an int refers to the page number, pagenumber=0 indicates page one;
"rectangleorder" an int refers to the order of rectangles within the page, rectangleorder=0 indicates the first rectangle;

Argument collection:
Extract the argument values from the instruction and store them as a dictionary for the text manipulator instance. Here is an example dictionary including all possible attributes:
argument = {"Clip": extracted target rectangle; "text": a string of new texts, "font": a string refers to the font of the text; "fontsize": an int refers to the font size; "textcolor": a string refers to the color of the text; "rotate": an int in 90, 180, 270, refers to the rotation of the text, "align": a fitz_constant selected from ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_RIGHT``` or ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT``` or ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER``` or ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_JUSTIFY``` refers to the alignment of the text}
The drafter will selectively specify parameters such as font, font size, text color, rotation, alignment, etc. as needed, so please create a dictionary for each task that matches the description.

Popular PDF editing library "PyMuPDF" and a user-tailored library "PDFbf" are provided. You can import the two libraries by:
"import fitz
import PDFbf"

File open:
You can open the file by calling the following function:
"doc = fitz.open("filepath")" Open the file with the file path.

Save the updated file:
You can save the file with an updated name by calling the following function:
"
updated_file = filepath[:-4] + "_updated.pdf" # update file path
doc.save(updated_file)
"

Target position extraction:
An annotation extractor is instantiated by providing the essential arguments document(doc):
"annoextractor = PDFbf.extractanno(doc=fitz.document)"
Get a rectangle and its reference points:
"rectangle, rfpoint = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=int,rectangleorder=int)"


Text adding:
A text manipulator is instantiated by specifying the essential arguments (document(doc), pagenumber, clip, text) and mentioned optional arguments (font, fontsize, text color, rotate, align). Here is an example with all possible arguments are mentioned:
"Text_manipulator=PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=fitz.document, pagenumber=int, clip=rectangle, text=string, font=string, fontsize=int, textcolor=string, rotate=int, align=fitz_constant)"
You can get a doc with texts added by calling the following function:
"doc=Text_manipulator.addtext()"

Incomplete instruction recording:
A missing key attribute recorder can be instantiated to record the incomplete instruction by providing the essential arguments(missing_information):
"recorder = PDFbf.recorder(missing_information=str)"
Where "missing_information" is a string indicating the highest-level of missing information, a standard format is '''file-level: value or missing, page-level: value or missing, order-level: value or missing, base-level: related part in the original instruction or missing(if no realted part) or related part in the original instruction following with an "incomplete" in brack (if there is some related description but some necessary information is missing) '''.
The incomplete instruction can be recorded by calling the following function:
"recorder.recording()"

Here is an example and you should respond in a similar way.
User: The file name is "a123gfsdfd_text.pdf". In the second box of page three, add the text "Project Alpha" with font "times-roman", align left, and add text "Phase 1" with font "helv", rotation 0. In the fourth box of page five, add text with font courier and add the text "Approved" with text color blue, font size 14, align justify.

Response:
```python

import fitz
import PDFbf

#file 1
filepath = "a123gfsdfd_text.pdf"
doc = fitz.open(filepath)

annoextractor = PDFbf.extractanno(doc=doc)

# page 3
pagenumber0=2

# rectangle 2
rectangleorder0=1
rectangle0, rfpoint0 = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=pagenumber0,rectangleorder=rectangleorder0)
# text string 1
argument0 = dict(clip=rectangle0, text="Project Alpha", font="times-roman", align=fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT)
Text_manipulator0 = PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber0, clip=argument0.get("clip"), text=argument0.get("text"), font=argument0.get("font"), align=argument0.get("align"))
doc = Text_manipulator0.addtext()
# text string 2
argument1 = dict(clip=rectangle0, text="Phase 1", font="helv", rotate=0)
Text_manipulator1 = PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber0, clip=argument1.get("clip"), text=argument1.get("text"), font=argument1.get("font"), rotate=argument1.get("rotate"), align=argument1.get("align"))
doc = Text_manipulator1.addtext()

# Page 5
pagenumber1=4
# rectangle 4
rectangleorder1=3
rectangle1, rfpoint1 = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=pagenumber1,rectangleorder=rectangleorder1)

# text string 3 base_level missing
missing_inf2 = '''file-level: a123gfsdfd_text.pdf, page-level: 5, order-level: 4, base-level: add text with font courier(incomplete)'''
recorder2 = PDFbf.recorder(missing_information=missing_inf2)
recorder2.recording()

# text string 4
argument3 = dict(clip=rectangle1, text="Approved", textcolor="blue", fontsize=14, align=fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_JUSTIFY)
Text_manipulator3 = PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber1, clip=argument3.get("clip"), text=argument3.get("text"), textcolor=argument3.get("textcolor"), fontsize=argument3.get("fontsize"), align=argument3.get("align"))
doc = Text_manipulator3.addtext()

updatedfilepath = filepath[:-4] + "_updated.pdf"
doc.save(updatedfilepath)
```
