Task background:
You're a worker using tools provided by the drafter to implement his instruction on technical drawing editing tasks.
Now, the drafter wants to update the text format on the target area boxed by rectangle markups. The possible format attributes are: font, font size, alignment, text color. The necessary information for such a task has four levels, which are file-level (providing the file path), page-level (providing page number), order-level (providing rectangle order on the page), and base-level(providing at least one of the format attributes) from high to low. A lower level information can correspond to only one higher level information, while higher level information can correspond to multiple lower-level information. You need to find the necessary information corresponding to each task from an instruction that may contain multiple tasks to complete the execution of the instruction. Don't assume the value of missing necessary information (if a format attribute is mentioned without specifying the value clearly, you can only assume that value), but identify tasks lacking necessary information, record the missing details, and execute the task only once all essential information is gathered. Don't repeat the operations related to the same higher-level information when dealing with lower-level operations. Avoid using loops.

Task plan:
The following is a standard process for completing a task:
0.	Inexecutable task recording: If you think a level of necessary information(file-level, page-level, order-level, base-level) for a task is missing in the instruction, don't assume the value but skip all the operations of that task and create a recorder to record the incomplete instruction, then continue on next task. Otherwise, ignore this step if all four levels of necessary information of a task can be found.
1.	Import libraries
2.	Open the file.
3.	Target position extraction: Crate an annotation extractor and extract the rectangles on the target page and order.
4.	Argument collection: Prepare parameters for updating text format by modifying the argument's value specified by the drafter's instructions into a dictionary.
5.	Update format: create a text manipulator instance, extract original text, refresh the text formate.
6.	Save the file.

Available tools:
Two constant defined by the user:
"pagenumber": an int refers to the page number, pagenumber=0 indicates page one;
"rectangleorder" an int refers to the order of rectangles within the page, rectangleorder=0 indicates the first rectangle;

Argument collection:
Extract the argument values from the instruction and store them as a dictionary for the text position-changing task. Here is an example dictionary including all possible attributes:
{"clip": a rectangle boxes the text that needed to be updated; "font": a string refers to the font of the text; "fontsize":an int refers to the font size; "align": a constant get by ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_RIGHT``` or ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT``` or ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER``` or ```fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_JUSTIFY``` refers to the alignment of the text in box;"rotate": an int in 0, or 90 refers to the direction of the text, 0 means horizontal text, 90 means vertical text, if the direction of the text is not mentioned, the text is horizontal text; "textcolor": a string refers to the color of the text}

Popular PDF editing library "PyMuPDF" and a user-tailored library "PDFbf" are provided. You can import the two libraries by:
"import fitz
import PDFbf"

File open:
You can open the file by calling the following function:
"doc = fitz.open("filepath")" Open the file with the file path.

Save the updated file:
You can save the file with an updated name by calling the following function:
"
updated_file = filepath[:-4] + "_updated.pdf" # update file path
doc.save(updated_file)
"

Target position extraction:
An annotation extractor is instantiated by providing the essential arguments document(doc):
"annoextractor = PDFbf.extractanno(doc=fitz.document)"
Get a rectangle and its reference points:
"rectangle, rfpoint = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=int,rectangleorder=int)"


Update format:
A text manipulator is instantiated by specifying arguments (document(doc), page number(pagenumber), clip) and optional arguments (font, fontsize, textcolor, rotate, align) on demand like this: "Text_manipulator=PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=fitz.document,pagenumber=int,clip=rectangle,font=string,fontsize=int,textcolor=string,rotate=int, align=fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT)"
You can extract the original horizontal text by calling the following function:
"Text_manipulator.text = Text_manipulator.gethortext()"
You can get a string of original vertical text by calling the following function:
"Text_manipulator.text = Text_manipulator.getvertext()"
After extracting the original text, you can get a doc with the original text covered by refreshed new text added by calling the following functions:
"doc = Text_manipulator.addtext()"

Incomplete instruction recording:
A missing key attribute recorder can be instantiated to record the incomplete instruction by providing the essential arguments(missing_information):
"recorder = PDFbf.recorder(missing_information=str)"
Where "missing_information" is a string indicating the highest-level of missing information, a standard format is '''file-level: value or missing, page-level: value or missing, order-level: value or missing, base-level: related part in the original instruction or missing(if no related part) or related part in the original instruction following with an "incomplete" in a brace (if there is some related description but some necessary information is missing) '''.
The incomplete instruction can be recorded by calling the following function:
"recorder.recording()"


Here is an example. You should respond in the same way.
User: The file name is "234_Manipdfgwulate_text.pdf". For the vertical text in the second box of the fifth page, change the words color to green, center align. For the text in the fourth box of the eighth page, change the font to "times-roman" and the font size to 14. Update the text in the sixth box of the twelfth page.
Response:
```python

import fitz
import PDFbf

#task 1
#file 1
filepath = "234_Manipdfgwulate_text.pdf"
doc = fitz.open(filepath)

annoextractor = PDFbf.extractanno(doc=doc)

#page 1
pagenumber0 = 4
#rectangle 1
rectangleorder0 = 1
rectangle0, rfpoint0 = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=pagenumber0,rectangleorder=rectangleorder0)
argument0 = dict(clip=rectangle0, rotate=90, textcolor="green", align=fitz.TEXT_ALIGN_CENTER)
Text_manipulator0 = PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber0, clip=argument0.get("clip"), rotate=argument0.get("rotate"), textcolor=argument0.get("textcolor"), align=argument0.get("align"))
Text_manipulator0.text = Text_manipulator0.getvertext()
doc = Text_manipulator0.addtext()

#task 2
#page 2
pagenumber1 = 7
#rectangle 2
rectangleorder1 = 3
rectangle1, rfpoint1 = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=pagenumber1,rectangleorder=rectangleorder1)
argument1 = dict(clip=rectangle1, font="times-roman", fontsize=14)
Text_manipulator1 = PDFbf.manipulate_text(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber1, clip=argument1.get("clip"), font=argument1.get("font"), fontsize=argument1.get("fontsize"))
Text_manipulator1.text = Text_manipulator1.gethortext()
doc = Text_manipulator1.addtext()

#task 3
missing_information1 = '''file-level:234_Manipdfgwulate_text.pdf, page-level: 12, order-level: 6, base-level: missing'''
recorder2 = PDFbf.recorder(missing_information=missing_information1)
recorder2.recording()

updatedfilepath = filepath[:-4] + "_updated.pdf"
doc.save(updatedfilepath)
```
