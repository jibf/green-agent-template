Task background:
You're a worker using tools provided by the drafter to implement his instruction on technical drawing editing tasks.
Now, the drafter wants to change the position of a table on the target area boxed by rectangle markups. There are three operations that the drafter may want: translation, rotation, and scaling. The details defining the operation include operation type, direction, and magnitude. The necessary information for such a task has four levels, which are file-level (providing the file path), page-level (providing page number), order-level (providing rectangle order on the page), and base-level(providing the details for at least one of the three operations) from high to low. What needs to be made more clear is that the details defining each type of operation that can be considered as necessary information are: pairs of information consisting of the type of operation and the direction, translation-direction, rotation-direction, and scale-bigger or smaller, respectively. A lower level information can correspond to only one higher level information, while higher level information can correspond to multiple lower-level information. You need to find the necessary information corresponding to each task from an instruction that may contain multiple tasks to complete the execution of the instruction. Don't assume the value of missing necessary information (only the magnitude of operation can be assumed), but identify tasks lacking necessary information, record the missing details, and execute the task that all essential information is gathered. Don't repeat the operations related to the same higher-level information when dealing with lower-level operations. Avoid using loops.

Task plan:
The following is a standard process for completing a task:
0.	Inexecutable task recording: If you think a level of necessary information(file-level, page-level, order-level, base-level) for a task is missing in the instruction, don't assume the value but skip all the operations of that task and create a recorder to record the incomplete instruction, then continue on next task. Otherwise, ignore this step if all four levels of necessary information of a task can be found.
1.	Import libraries
2.	Open the file.
3.	Target position extraction: Crate an annotation extractor and extract the rectangles on the target page and order.
4.	Argument collection: Prepare parameters for changing a table position by modifying the argument's value specified by the drafter's instructions into a dictionary.
5.	Changing position: Create a table projector instance and change position.
6.	Save the file.

Available tools:
Two constant defined by the user:
"pagenumber": an int refers to the page number, pagenumber=0 indicates page one;
"rectangleorder" an int refers to the order of rectangles within the page, rectangleorder=0 indicates the first rectangle;

Argument collection:
Extract the argument values from the instruction and store them as a dictionary for the table position-changing task. Here is an example dictionary including all possible attributes:
{"clip": a rectangle boxes the text that need to be dealt with; "move": a list refers to translation details, general form: [move in its right direction (positive value if move right, negative value if move left), move in its upper direction (positive value if move up, negative value if move down), reference_point], "rotation": a list refers to the rotation details, general form: ['r', rotation degrees in the clockwise direction (positive value in clockwise direction, negative value in counterclockwise direction),reference_point], if the direction of rotation is not specified, clockwise is considered; "scal": a list refers to the scaling, general form: [‘sc’, [zoom factor X direction, zoom factor Y direction], reference_point]}

Popular PDF editing library "PyMuPDF" and a user-tailored library "PDFbf" are provided. You can import the two libraries by:
"import fitz
import PDFbf"

File open:
You can open the file by calling the following function:
"doc = fitz.open("filepath")" Open the file with the file path.

Save the updated file:
You can save the file with an updated name by calling the following function:
"
updated_file = filepath[:-4] + "_updated.pdf" # update file path
doc.save(updated_file)
"

Target position extraction:
An annotation extractor is instantiated by providing the essential arguments document(doc):
"annoextractor = PDFbf.extractanno(doc=fitz.document)"
Get a rectangle and its reference points:
"rectangle, rfpoint = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=int,rectangleorder=int)"

Changing position:
A projector is instantiated by specifying the essential arguments (document(doc), page number(pagenumber), clip) and optional arguments (movement of translation (move), rotation(rotation) and scaling(scal)) like this:
"table_projector=PDFbf.Projector(doc=fitz.document,pagenumber=int,clip=rectangle,move=[move_in_right_direction, move_in_up_direction, reference_point],rotation=['r', rotation degrees in clockwise direction,reference_point],scal=['sc',[zoom factor in X direction, zoom factor in Y direction], reference_point])"
You can get a doc with a table mapped by calling following functions:
"doc = table_projector.project()"

Incomplete instruction recording:
A missing key attribute recorder can be instantiated to record the incomplete instruction by providing the essential arguments(missing_information):
"recorder = PDFbf.recorder(missing_information=str)"
Where "missing_information" is a string indicating the missing information, the standard format is '''file-level: value or missing, page-level: value or missing, order-level: value or missing, base-level: the relevant part of the original instruction, missing if there is no such part, fill in the relevant part of the original instruction following an 'incomplete' in brackets if there is a relevant part but not enough necessary information'''.
The incomplete instruction can be recorded by calling the following function:
"recorder.recording()"

Here is an examples. You should respond in the same way.

User: The file name is "47_mapqweqping_table.pdf". Move the table in the first box on page 5 20 units left,30 units up. Rotate another table 45 degrees clockwise. Move the table in the second box of the tenth page 10 units left, 20 units down.
Response:
```python
import fitz
import PDFbf

#Task 1
#File 1
filepath = "47_mapqweqping_table.pdf"
doc = fitz.open(filepath)

annoextractor = PDFbf.extractanno(doc=doc)


# page 5
pagenumber0 = 4
#rectangle 1
rectangleorder0 = 0
rectangle0, rfpoint0 = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=pagenumber0,rectangleorder=rectangleorder0)
#Mapping 1
argument0 = dict(clip=rectangle0, move=[-20, 30, rfpoint0])
table_project0 = PDFbf.Projector(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber0, clip=argument0.get("clip"), move=argument0.get("move"))
doc = table_project0.project()

#Task 2
# Recording the missing information for Task 2 (not enough details for rotating a table)
missing_information1 = '''file-level:47_mapqweqping_table.pdf, page-level: missing, order-level: missing, base-level: rotate 45 degrees clockwise'''

recorder1 = PDFbf.recorder(
    missing_information=missing_information1
)
recorder1.recording()

#Task 3
#Page 10
pagenumber1 = 9
#rectangle 2
rectangleorder1 = 1
rectangle1, rfpoint1 = annoextractor.getclip_rfpoint(pagenumber=pagenumber1,rectangleorder=rectangleorder1)
# Mapping 3
argument2 = dict(clip=rectangle1, move=[-10, -20, rfpoint1])
table_project2 = PDFbf.Projector(doc=doc, pagenumber=pagenumber1, clip=argument1.get("clip"), move=argument1.get("move"))
doc = table_project2.project()

updatedfilepath = filepath[:-4] + "_updated.pdf"
doc.save(updatedfilepath)
```
